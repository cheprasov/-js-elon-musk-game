## What need to do, and what I have not done, because it is just for a test exercise.
- I did not write js tests for code, sorry. I know that is worst practise.
- Optimization for web (minification for js and css, sprites for images, compression for images and mp3)
- More smooth behaviour for rockets.
- Use WebGL for render (pixi.js).
- More browsers for test. I have tested the game only on Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
